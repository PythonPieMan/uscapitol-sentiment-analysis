Sentiment Analysis on Tweets about the "US Capitol"

Yesterday, the US Capitol was breached for the first time since the 19th century. Inspired by my growing interest in NLP, I decided to conduct a sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion regarding the events of this week. I used both Python and R for this analysis, and included information on tweet Polarity, Subjectivity, Term Prevalence, and Emotions.

Soon, I hope to update this analysis by adding information on most frequently associated words in the tweets using the Apyori Eclat method.
